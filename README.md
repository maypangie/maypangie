<h1>Student of Life | Software Engineer</h1>

To know anything is to know that I know nothing at all.

I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Artist, always eager to learn new things and expand my skills. 
Constantly inspired to grow, explore new techniques and to keep my input in a rapidly evolving digital world and how I am able to help shape it.

When I'm not coding or creating, I enjoy exploring in nature, rollerskating, cooking, discovering new bars/restaurants, art museums, books, movies and listening to podcasts.
